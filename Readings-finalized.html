<p>&lt;!-- ## Feb 15 <a href="https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/423723/files/41434444/download?download_frd=1">Analytical Modeling - Intro to Game Theory and Information Economics</a></p>
<p>In this &amp; next sections, we focus on the analytical modeling arm of econ of IS. Since many of you have not received training on game theory or microeconomics, this section serves two purposes:
First, a quick introduction to game theory that helps you develop an understanding of game theory terminologies and concepts. Second, we read two classical applications
of game theory that has broad applications on management research: signaling games and principal-agent research (e.g. I have used signaling games in at least two of my papers).
Both papers are examples of &quot;<strong>information economics</strong>&quot; where information asymmetry is a central issue. We use these papers both as examples of game theory applications
and an opportunity to learn some important economic theories.</p>

<h2>Apr 18 <a href="https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/423723/files/42645524/download?download_frd=1">Field experiments</a> (Guest Professor: Sofia Bapna)</h2>
<p><strong>Special Instructions from Prof Bapna</strong></p>
<p>Students will be expected to read all 4 papers. Each student can be assigned to present one of the papers attached; for the paper they are assigned they need to present the following (in blue). We can discuss issues as they arise in each presentation. You can present for 20 minutes each, leaving 10 minutes to discuss each paper. Plus 30 minutes at the end for Prof Bapna to conclude with a short presentation and answer questions (total 2.5 hours).</p>
<p>For the paper you are assigned please have at least 1 slide for each of the following items. The slides should be in the order mentioned below. The presentation time and discussion with the group for your paper is 30 minutes. So your presentation should be 20 minutes.</p>
<ol>
<li>What was the research question?</li>
<li>Who was the partner organization? What was their role?</li>
<li>How many experimental conditions were there? What were they (e.g. control received X, Treatment 1 received Y)? What was the driver behind each condition (i.e., why was each condition used and was it motivated by theory)? Was there any deception involved in the treatments (if yes, what was the nature of the deception)?</li>
<li>What was the control and why was it used? Is there an obvious experimental condition that is missing?</li>
<li>What were the outcomes? Are they convincing? If outcome assessments were performed at several time points after randomization, state the time points that they were collected. Were the outcomes easy to collect? Is there a different outcome that should have been measured?</li>
<li>Who were the subjects/participants and how were they recruited? Comment on the external validity of the study based on the participants?</li>
<li>Were participants aware that they were part of the study (was there informed consent)?</li>
<li>What was the sample size and the number of subjects in each experimental condition?</li>
<li>What was the randomization method and what were the balance checks?</li>
<li>Was there attrition (which occurs when participants drop out of the study)? How much attrition was there?</li>
<li>What heterogeneity analysis was conducted? What (if any) value did it add to the paper?</li>
<li>What robustness tests/ additional analyses were conducted?</li>
<li>Were there manipulation tests? What were they and were they convincing?</li>
<li>How were mechanisms explored? Was it convincing?</li>
<li>Treasure hunt - Complete the linked SPIRIT 2013 FILLABLE CHECKLIST which includes 33 items that should be considered before running the trial https://spirit-statement.org/publications-downloads/; For our class proposes, your task is to identify which items from the checklist were reported in the paper that you were assigned (start from item 6a). Bring to class the completed sheet and include in the side the items you did not find in the paper (include the item # from the list and the related question).</li>
<li>Questions you have about the paper (optional)</li>
